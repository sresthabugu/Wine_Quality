# Wine_Quality_Prediction

 "Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression" involves building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its various features. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks, and it's a suitable choice for predicting continuous numeric values, such as wine quality scores.

 *** steps involved in my project  ***
**Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset containing information about wine features and their corresponding quality scores.

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing or inconsistent values, and perform feature scaling. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into feature distributions, correlations, and their relationship with the target variable (wine quality) using data visualization techniques.

**Linear Regression Model**: Utilize linear regression as the machine learning algorithm, assuming a linear relationship between independent features and wine quality.

**Model Training**: Train the linear regression model using the training data, allowing the model to adjust its coefficients to find the best-fitting line minimizing prediction errors.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained linear regression model using the testing data. Common regression metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared are used for evaluation.

**Model Interpretation**: Interpret the model's coefficients to understand each feature's contribution to wine quality prediction.

**Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen wine samples, providing estimated quality scores based on their features.
